Data Journalism 2022-23 | JOMEC

This is the material and weekly structure for the Data Journalism module taught at Cardiff University's School of Journalism in the Autumn 2021 semester ([MSc in Computational & Data Journalism](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/courses/course/computational-and-data-journalism-msc)). The course runs for 12 weeks with a four-hour class and a three-hour workshop every week. Questions and observations welcome at odonnella4@cardiff.ac.uk or @aodhanlutetiae.

Description

Data journalism at its broadest sees any information in a digitised form as a potential journalistic resource. Digging for this information with computerised tools and supplementing it with traditional journalistic methods is the task of the data journalist. Stories are generated when imagination and curiosity are combined with numerical and technical skills; this module sees students apply technology to journalistic questions and begin to produce a portfolio of work.
